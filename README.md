# Analysis-of-US-Hospitals-Diabetes-Data
I utilised SQL and Power BI to perform a comprehensive analysis of US Hospital Diabetes Data from the years 1999-2008. 
I chose this dataset due to how extensive it was, allowing me to highlight my exploratory data analysis capabilities.

The project includes:

- **Introduction:** Providing an overview of the project and the dataset under examination.
- **Data Cleaning and Exploration:** Rigorous cleaning procedures and a thorough exploration of the dataset to ensure data integrity and uncover initial insights.
- **Specific Business Questions and Analysis:** Addressing targeted business questions and performing in-depth analyses to derive actionable insights.
- **Open-ended Exploratory Data Analysis:** Delving into broader exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns, trends, and outliers.
- **Conclusion and Key Findings:** Concluding the project and highlighting key findings.

I decided to publish this project on Notion as it preserved the structure of this document with static graphs. This ensures that the audience can easily navigate through the analysis, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the insights derived from the US Hospital Diabetes Data.
